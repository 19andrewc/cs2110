# **[CS 2110] - Week 2: Datatypes Part 2**
## Hexadecimal And Octal
- binary -> octal
	- convert groups of 3 binary bit into 1 octal digit
- octal -> binary
	- convert each octal digit into a 3 digit binary bit
-  binary -> hexadecimal
	- convert groups of 4 binary bit into 1 hexadecimal digit
- hexadecimal -> binary
	- convert each hexadecimal digit into a 4 digit binary bit

- in Java and C
	- 456 is decimal
	- 0456 is octal
	- 0x456 is hexadecimal

## ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)

![[../img/w2-ss3-ascii-tricks2.png|300]]
![[../img/w2-ss4-ascii-tricks3.png|300]]
- ASCII was designed so that masks could be used to relate certain characters
	- lower-case to/from upper case letters -> flip bit 5
	- and many more...

## Floating Point (IEEE-754)
- floating point: $<sign>\ <1.number> \times <base>^{<exponent-127>}$
		- ex. $-6.023 \times 10^{-23}$
- non-normalized floating point: $<sign>\ <0.number> \times <base>^{<exponent-126>}$

- but we can't represent zero...
- below are the corner cases...

|decimal|floating point|
|-|-|
|$0$|$0\ 00000000\ 0000000000000000000000$|
|$-0$|$1\ 00000000\ 0000000000000000000000$|
|$\infty$|$0\ 11111111\ 0000000000000000000000$|
|$-\infty$|$1\ 11111111\ 0000000000000000000000$|
|$NaN$|$1\ 11111111\ 0000001000000000000000$|
|$NaN$|$1\ 11111111\ 1010000010000010000100$|

## Not A Number (NaN)
- suppose A is a floating point number set to NaN
	- A != B is true, when B is another floating point number (NaN, infinity, or anything)
	- A != A is true (meaning A is not equal to itself)
- if A or B is NaN, the following are all false
	- A < B
	- A > B
	- A == B

## Casting Int To Float
- int has 32 significant digits, float has 24 significant digits
	- conversions from int to float won't be exact

## Double (IEEE-754)
![[../img/w2-ss7-double-ieee754.png|400]]
- same as floating point, just different number of bits

## Casting Int To Double
- int has 32 significant digits, double has 64 significant digits
	- conversions from int to double will be exact

## Comparing Two Floating Point Numbers
- if either is NaN, the comparison is defined as "unordered" (all comparisons to it except for != are false)
- if either is -0.0, replace with 0.0
- if signs are different, positive number is greater
- compare the rest of the bits as integers
	- treat bits 0-31 (all except for signed bit) as an unsigned integer and compare as if they are integers
- if signs are both negative, reverse the comparison
