# **[CS 2110] - Week 3: Digital Logic**
## Complementary Transistors
- n-Type MOS
	- switch is normally open
	- applying current closes the switch
- p-Type MOS
	- swtich is normally closed
	- applying current opens the switch

- a wire with some designated voltage (ex. +9.0V) can represent a logical 1
- a wire with some designated voltage (ex. 0V or ground) can represent a logical 0
- a wire that is not connnected to 9.0V or ground is in a floating or high impedence state (value randomly varies from 0 to 1)

## De Morgan's Law
- $(A'\&B')'=A\|B$
- $(A'|B')'=A\&B$

## Conte Bubble Theorem
![[../img/w3-ss4-conte-bubble-theorem.png|400]]
- flip gates (OR -> AND, AND -> OR)
- flip inputs and outputs by adding or removing a bubble (NOT)

## Larger Gates
![[../img/w3-ss5-larger-gates.png|400]]
- (AB)(CD) is faster than (A(B(CD)))

## Combinational Logic
- a combination of AND, OR, NNOT (plus NAND and NOR)
- Note: the same inputs produce the same output

## Decoder
- will turn on at most 1 output, based on which input bits are set
- $n$ input bits will produce $2^n$ outputs for a decoder
- less inputs than outputs

![[../img/w3-ss6-decoder.png|375]]

## Multiplexor (MUX)
- a multiplexor has:
	- $2^n$ inputs
	- $n$ selector bits (aka control inputs)
	- $1$ output
- selects between inputs using a selector
- more inputs than outputs

![[../img/w3-ss7-multiplexor.png|375]]
- bubble = 0
- wire = 1
- each gate of the decoder is "represented" by a binary number using bubbles and wires

## Demultiplexor (DEMUX)
- sends the input across exactly one of the output lines
- other outputs remain 0
- a demultiplexor has:
	- $2^n$ outputs
	- $n$ selector bits
	- $1$ input
- more outputs than inputs

![[../img/w3-ss11-demultiplexor.png|375]]

## Simple Adder
- sum -> use XOR gate

## Half-Adder
- sum -> use A XOR B
- carry out -> use A AND B

## Full-Adder
- add carry-in bits

## Boolean Simplification
![[../img/w3-ss10-boolean-simplification.png|700]]

## Classic Sequence vs. Gray Code Sequence
- gray code sequence never has two switches changing at the same time

|Classic Sequence|Gray Code Sequence|
|-|-|
|000|000|
|001|001|
|010|011|
|011|010|
|100|110|
|101|111|
|110|101|
|111|100|

- gray code also allows you to loop around from the end to beginning (100 -> 000)

## Karnaugh Map
- a method of simplifying boolean expressions by grouping together related terms
	- two adjacent 1's in the map means there is a $x+x'$ in the formula
- results in the simplest sum-of-products expression possible
- allows for "don't care" outputs

|A|B|C|func(A,B,C)|
|-|-|-|-|
|0|0|0|X|
|0|0|1|0|
|0|1|0|0|
|0|1|1|1|
|1|0|0|1|
|1|0|1|1|
|1|1|0|0|
|1|1|1|1|

1. Create the K-Map
	- using a truth table distribute variables across rows and columns using gray code order
	- fill in corresponding entries

|.|AB|AB'|A'B'|A'B|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|**C**|1|1|0|1|
|**C'**|0|1|X|0|

2. Make groupings
	- grouping rules
		- groups must be rectangular (may wrap around edges!)
		- groups may only contain 1s or Xs
		- all 1s must be contained within at least one group
		- groups must be as large as possible
		- the size of a group must be a power of 2
		- overlaps are allowed

|.|AB|AB'|A'B'|A'B|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|**C**|1*|1**|0|1*|
|**C'**|0|1**|X|0|
$*$ denotes one group
$**$ denotes another group

3.  Write the simplified equation
	- pull out the simplified expression based on K-Map groupings

$$(ABC+A'BC)+(AB'C+AB'C')$$
$$BC+AB'$$

## Programmable Logic Array/(Field) Programmable Gate Array (PLA/PGA/FPGA)
- given a truth table, we can implement its outputs using a series of NOT gates, AND gates, and then OR gates
- we need $2^n$ AND gates where $n$ is the number of inputs
- we need 1 OR gate for each output
- PLA/PGA/FPGA devices exist for this reason

## Combinational vs. Sequential Logic
- combinational
	- combination of AND, OR, NOT (plus NAND & NOR)
	- same inputs always produce the same output
	- analogous to a cheap bicycle lock

- sequential
	- requires storage elemennts
	- output depends on inputs plus the state
	- analogous to a RLR combination lock
	- used to build memory and state machines

## Basic Storage
- composed of 2 NOT transistors

![[../img/w3-ss11-basic-storage.png|250]]

## R/S Latch
- stores a bit

![[../img/w3-ss12-rs-latch.png|250]]

## Gated D Latch
- when write enable (WE) is turned on, changes in the D latch is recorded on the R/S latch
- **level-triggered device**: it will store whatever value is present on the input when the write enable goes from true to false

![[../img/w3-ss13-gated-d-latch.png|350]]

## Register
- an array of gated D latches

![[../img/w3-ss14-register.png|400]]

## Definitions
- **address space**: the number of memory addresses that exist (how many addresses are possible?)
	- an n-bit address line can represent $2^n$ memory addresses
	- ex. If you have a memory with a 16-bit address in which each byte is given a distinct memory address, what is this memoryâ€™s address space?
		- $2^16$
- **addressability**: the amount of data stored at any given memory address (how big is each memory location?)
	- ex. If you have a memory with a 16-bit address in which each byte is given a distinct memory address, what is the addressability of this memory?
		- 8 bits (because 8 bits, per byte)
	- ex. What is the addressability of a system with 16 KiB (16384 bytes) of memory, composed of 2048 memory addresses?
		- 8 bytes (16384 / 2048) or 64 bits
- addressability $\times$ address space = amount of storage

## Clock Edges
![[../img/w3-ss15-clock-edges.png|500]]
- the problem with level-triggered devices in sequential circuits is that the output of the device is used in computing the input to the same device
	- aka we don't know when the we stop
- as a result, we use the leader-follower flip flop with 2 gated D latches

## Clock Edges And Leader-Follower
- edge-triggered device

![[../img/w3-ss16-clock-edges-leader-follower.png|500]]

## Finite State Machine (FSM) Diagram
- used to describe control logic

## Drawing An FSM Diagram
1. Decide how we will encode our states.
	- a binary number will always work
2. Draw a state diagram including:
	- labeled states (encoding)
	- outputs during the state
	- arcs with conditions for state changes
3. Create truth tables with:
	- inputs: circuit inputs and current state
	- output: circuit outputs and next state
	- fill in the outputs for all combinations based on the state diagram.
4. Implement a combinational circuit for each output using the truth table.

## State Machine For A Garage Door Opener
![[../img/w3-ss17-garage-door-opener.png|400]]
![[../img/w3-ss18-garage-door-opener-fsm-diagram.png|400]]
- the purpose of the dummy is to prevent "pressing and holding the button" from breaking our machine
	- the button must be released before it is possible to go to the next state

![[../img/w3-ss19-garage-door-opener-truth-table.png|400]]

- $N_0=P$ 
- $N_1 = C_1\textasciitilde{C_0}+PC_1+\textasciitilde{P}\textasciitilde{C_1}C_0$
- $N_2=P\textasciitilde{C_2}C_1C_0+PC_2+C_2\textasciitilde{C_1}+C_2\textasciitilde{C_0}$
- $U=\textasciitilde{C_2}C_1\textasciitilde{C_0}$
- $D=C_2C_1\textasciitilde{C_0}$

## Two Kinds Of State Machines
1. one hot
	- one bit per state
	- only onen bit is on at a time
	- faster
	- requires more flip flops
	- states progress 00001 >> 00010 >> 00100 >> 01000 >> 10000
2. binary encoded
	- encode state as a binary number
	- use a decoder to generate a line for each state
	- slower
	- more complicated
	- states progress
	- 000 >> 001 >> 010 > 011 >> 100
