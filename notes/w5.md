# **[CS 2110] - Week 5: LC-3 Part 1**
## Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
- **ISA**: specifies all the information about the computer that the software needs to be aware of
- ISA is a programmer’s view of the CPU (ex. LC-3) from the outside (how do I write machine code/assembly?)
- the internal implementation of the LC-3 is the datapath and microcode

## Who Uses An ISA?
- machine language programmers
- assembly language programmers
- compiler writers
- high-level language programmers interested in performance, debugging, etc.

## ISA: What Is Specified
- memory organization
- registers
- instruction set
	- opcodes
	- data types
	- addressing modes

## LC-3 Memory Organization
- address space
	- 16 bit addresses
	- 0-65535
	- x0-xFFFF
- addressability
	- 16 bits
- word addressable/byte addressable?
	- strictly word addressable with 16 bit words

## LC-3 Registers
- general purpose registers
	- 8 general purpose registers
	- R0-R7
- Is the PC considered to be a GPR?
	- no
- conventions
	- certain registers will have designated purposes (that comes later, for now you can use all 8 of them)

## How Many Instructions? (ISA Design Philosophies)
- lots
	- CISC (complex instruction set computer)
	- ex. Intel X86, DEC VAX, IBM Z-series
	- do as much as you can in a single instruction
	- relatively easy to write efficient machine code by hand
- few
	- RISC (reduced instruction set computer)
	- ARM, PowerPC, MIPS, LC-3
	- expose as much as you can to the compiler so that it can optimize it
	- hard to write efficient machine code by hand

## LC-3 Machine Code And Assembly Language
- for now, we are focused on the LC-3 datapath
	- the circuit implementation and the state machine
	- the control signals that make each instruction happen
- you will need to understand what each LC-3 machine code instruction does (atomically, in isolation)
	- what registers or memory locations does it change?
	- which ALU operation is happening?
	- how does the data flow through each MUX and the bus to make the operation execute with the desired behavior?
- you do NOT need to understand why or how you would use these instructions in a program yet
	- will be covered later, with assembly programming
	- for now, just understand each instruction’s behavior, so you can know how to implement it in the datapath and microcode, using control signals

## LC-3 Instruction Set
- 16-bit instructions
- 4 bits for opcode (bits 15-12)
- how many instructions?
	- 15 (code 1101 is reserved for future use)

## LC-3 Assembly Language
- a symbolic (text, human readable) representation of the binary machine language
- instructions are one-to-one between assembly language and machine language
- ex. ADD R1, R2, R3

## Categories Of LC-3 Instructions
- operate (ALU) - only takes 1 cycle for the EXECUTE phase to run
	- ADD
	- AND
	- NOT
- data movement (memory)
	- load
		- LD
		- LDR
		- LDI
		- LEA
	- store
		- ST
		- STR
		- STI
- control
	- BR
	- JMP
	- JSR
	- JSRR
	- RET
	- RTI
	- TRAP

## Machine Instruction Cycle
- FETCH, FETCH, FETCH, DECODE, EXECUTE
	- FETCH and DECODE are the same for every instruction


## Operate (ALU) Instructions
![[../img/w5-ss1-addressing-modes.png|500]]
- imm5 refers to an immediate value or literal
	- 1 and -1 are the most commonly used literals in high level language
	- using imm5 allows the machine to use only 1 register (rather than using 2 registers)
- the addressing mode depends on bit 5

## Addressing Modes (For ALU Operations)
- register
	- all operands come from register file
	- ex. ADD R1, R2, R3
	- ex. AND R1, R2, R3
- immediate or literal
	- some operands come from bits in the instruction itself (get them from the instruction register (IR)
	- immediate values are 5-bit two’s complement (for ADD and AND)
		- from bits \[0:4] in the instruction itself
	- sign-extend the immediate value to 16 bits two’s complement
		- ex. ADD R1, R2, #3
		- ex. AND R1, R2, \#-3

## Data Movement Instructions
- purpose
	- **load** data into a register (usually from memory)
	- **store** a register’s value out to memory

## Addressing Modes (For Data Movement)
- where can operands (data) be found?
	1.  in the instruction (literal or Immediate)
	2. in the registers
	3. in the memory
- **effective address**: used to describe the memory location that the instruction uses for its operands
- 3 addressing modes involve memory locations, at the effective address
	- PC-relative (pc + offset)
	- base + offset
	- indirect
- other 2 addressing modes
	- immediate or literal
	- register
- each instruction allows a subset of these addressing modes (a common approach in a RISC architecture)

## Effective Address
- how big is a machine instruction?
	- 16 bits
- how big is a memory address?
	- 16 bits
- can we fit a full memory address in a machine instruction?
	- no, because we need some bits for the op code and other parts of the instruction
