# **[CS 2110] - Week 4: Von Neumann Model**

## The Idea
- the central idea in the Von Neumann model of computer processing is that the **program** and **data** are both **stored** as sequences of bits in the **computer's memory**
	- the program is executed, one instruction at a time, under the direction of the control unit
- the Von Neumann model leads us to treat machine instructions as just another data representation
- what can be stored in memory?
	- data
	- instructions

## The LC-3 CPU
- address space: $2^16 = 65536$
- addressability: 16 bits
- architecture type: Von Neumann
- general purpose registers: 8
- instruction size: 16 bits

- the LC-3 CPU is just a combination of MUX, STATE, COMPUTE, MEMORY, and CONTROL

## Tri-State Buffer
- used to help with the bus
	- **bus**: 16 shared wires in the datapath
- has no transistors or logic, just wires to connect things
- are used to disconnect inputs so the bus can be shared among multiple components

|control|input|output|
|-|-|-|
|0|0|Z|
|0|1|Z|
|1|0|0|
|1|1|1|

- exactly 1 true output to prevent data path fires and short circuits

## Register File Circuit
- a small, fast "memory"
	- address space: 8 registers
	- 16-bit addressability per register
- 2 outputs
	- dual-ported memory
	- can read two registers at the same time
	- SR1 (3-bit address)
	- SR2 (3-bit address)
- 1 input
	- DR (3-bit address)
	- LD.REG (write enable)
- can read two registers and write one register in a single clock cycle

## What Is A Machine Instruction?
- just another data representation telling the processor what to do

## Categories Of Machine Instructions
- operate (ALU)
	- ADD
	- AND
	- NOT
- data movement (memory)
	- load
		- LD
		- LDR
		- LDI
		- LEA
	- store
		- ST
		- STR
		- STI
- control
	- BR
	- JMP
	- JSR
	- JSRR
	- RET
	- RTI
	- TRAP

## Instruction Example

- means $R2=R1+R3$

## How Do We Make LC-3 Do An "ADD"?
- LC-3 is controlled by a large finite state machine so it has output signals (control signals)
- the FSM turns on specific control signals in the LC-3
	- activates certain paths in the datapath, making it do certain things
- before FSM could execute ADD, it had to fetch the instruction from the memory
- the FSM has a procedure that executes over-and-over to process instructions
	- FETCH
	- DECODE
	- EXECUTE
- the FSM fetches and decodes each instruction before it executes it
- **instruction register (IR)**: holds the instruction currently being executed


## What Is A Machine Code Program?
- **machine code program**: a series of machine code instructions that is a 16-bit data value
- the instructions are stored in memory (usually in sequence, consecutive memory locations)
- each memory location has an address that is a 16-bit unsigned integer

## Program Counter (PC)
- **program counter (PC)**: register holds the address of the next instruction to be executed

![[../img/w4-ss5-program-counter-circuit.png]]
- PCMUX (2-bit MUX selector)
	- adder to increment PC by 1
	- data from bus to PC
	- data from effective address calculator to PC
- LD.PC (write enable)
	- write enable for PC register
- GatePC (tri-state buffer)
	- put PC value on bus
- program counter circuit uses 4 bits of control signals

## FETCH And DECODE
- FETCH, FETCH, FETCH
	- takes 3 clock cycles to read the instruction from memory
- DECODE
	- takes 1 clock cycle
- in total, 4 clock cycles are used to fetch and decode an instruction
	- happens at the beginning of every machine code instruction

## Instruction Processing: FETCH
- load next instruction (at the address stored in PC) from memory into instruction register (IR)
	- copy contents of PC to MAR (memory address register)
	- send "read" signal to the memory
	- copy contents of MDR (memory data register) into IR
- increment PC, so that it points to the next instruction in the sequence
	- PC becomes PC + 1

## Instruction Processing: DECODE
- first identify the opcode
	- on the LC-3, this is 4 bits (15:12)
	- the FSM chooses a next state corresponding to the desired opcode
- depending on opcode, identify other operands from the remaining bits
	- ex. for LDR, last six bits is offset
	- ex. for ADD, last three bits is source operand
- DECODE is the FSM!
	- it activates the control signals in the datapath

## Instruction Processing: EXECUTE
- perform the operation, using the source operands
	- ex. send operands to ALU and assert ADD control signal
	- ex. do nothing (for loads and stores to memory)
- what EXECUTE operation does depends...
	- every instruction has a different execute phase
	- with different control signals
- but every instruction starts with
	- FETCH, FETCH, FETCH, DECODE

## Instruction Processing Review
- instruction bits look just like data bits in memory – it’s all a matter of our interpretation
- three basic kinds of instructions
	- computational instructions (ADD, AND, NOT)
	- data movement instructions (LD, ST, ...)
	- control instructions (JMP, BRnz, ...)
- six basic phases of instruction processing
	- F -> D -> EA -> OP -> EX -> S -> repeat
	- not all phases are needed by every instruction
	- phases may take variable number of machine cycles (states)

## LC-3 Is A FSM
- has 64 possible states
- orchestrates 42 control signals
	- multiplexor selectors (PCMUX, MARMUX, ADDR2MUX, ...)
	- tri-state buffer enables (gatePC, gateMARMUX, gateALU, ...)
	- register write-enables (LD.PC, LD.REG, LD.MAR, LD.CC, ...)
	- other control signals (ALUK, MEM.EN, R.W, ...)
- the wires aren’t all shown explicitly on the datapath diagram to avoid clutter, but each signal has a name

## How Do We Implement The LC-3 State Machine?
- just like the garage door opener, we build logic to produce output control signals
- the garage door had 2 output signals: UP and DOWN
- the LC-3 has 42 control signals
	- these signals control the datapath (the MUX selectors, tri-state buffers, write enables (e.g LD.REG), etc
	- the output of the FSM is the 42 control signals
- the LC-3 is a glorified state machine
	- but works just like the garage door opener
	- it has 64 states, and 42 control signal outputs
