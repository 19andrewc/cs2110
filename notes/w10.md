## Memory Layout
- the traditional C executable has 3 segments
	- text
		- program code (unmodifiable)
		- constant data (maybe)
	-	data
		-	constant data (maybe)
		-	initialized variables
	- BSS
		- uninitialized static data
		- from "block starting with symbol"
		- aka ```.blkw``` from LC-3

## Scopes
- file scope
	- seen by the entire file after the definition
	- outside the function definition
	- the visibility of a global variable (across files) can be set using the keywords extern or static 

|\<no keyword\>|external definition|
|-|-|
|static|visible to no other files|
|extern|external reference (visible to other files, declares reference to an external definition elsewhere)|

- block scope
	- seen within the block, after the definition

### Global Scope Example
```
// file1.c
int a[10];			// external definition
static struc r *p;	// this file only
extern float c[100] // ref to c in file2.c


// file2.c
extern int a[10];	// ref to arr in file1.c
static struct r *p	// not the p in file1.c
float c[100];		// definition
```

### Block Scope Example
```
#include <stdio.h>
int i = 0;		// #1 -> 
void f(int);

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	i = 1;		// -> #1
	
	int i = 0	// #2 -> 
	i = 2;		// -> #2
	
	for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {		// #3 ->
		f(i);		// -> #3
		
		int i = 2;	// #4 ->
		f(i);		// -> #4
	}
	f(i);		// -> #2
}

void f(int j) {
	printf("%d\n", j);
}
```

## Storage Classes And Type Qualifiers
- storage class specifiers
	- register
	- auto
	- static extern
- type qualifiers
	- const
	- volatile
	- restrict

### Storage Class
- storage class tells us where the data will be stored and who will be able to see it
- it is not part of the type and only affects the variables defined or declared using it
- the rules for storage classes are not regular
	- you need to memorize them or have a ready reference

| |outside a function definition|inside a function definition|
|-|-|-|
|\<none\>|**scope**: external definition<br />**storage**: static address|**scope**: within the function<br />**storage**: on the stack|
|auto|N/A|**scope**: within the function<br />**storage**: on the stack|
|static|**scope**: within the file only<br />**storage**: static address|**scope**: within the function<br />**storage**: static address|
|extern|**scope**: external reference<br />**storage**: static address; location determined by file containing the external definition (can't have initializer either)|**scope**: external reference<br />**storage**: static address; location determined by file containing the external definition (can't have initializer either)|
|register|N/A|**scope**: within the function<br />**storage**: register or stack (hint to compiler; use of & not allowed, seldom used|

#### static Inside A Function
```
void funcCounter(void) {
	static int counter = 0; 	// one instance, static memory
	counter++;          	// visible only in function
	printf(“This function was called %d times.\n”, counter);
}
```
- counter is allocated once in the initialized data static area of memory
- counter is not located on the stack
- every call to ```funcCounter()``` sees the same shared instance of counter
- it is only initialized to 0 once at program load (not every time the function is called)
	- similar to .fill from LC-3

### Type Qualifier
- part of the type (unlike storage class)
- not mutually exclusive with a storage class'

|type qualifier|definition|
|-|-|
|const|the value of this variable may not be changed after initialization|
|volatile|the compiler may not optimize references to this variable|
|restrict|for the lifetime of a pointer, only the pointer itself or a value directly derived from it may be used to access the object to which it points; allows better optimization|

- static (has 2 meanings)
	- inside a function: static changes the storage location to static memory, either data or BSS segment (scope stays local)
	- outside a function: static changes the scope (visibility) to be only visible within the file (the storage location stays in static memory)
 - extern
	 - compiler does not allocate storage
	 - for type checking of the identifier name only
	 - another C file must allocate storage by defining that var name or function
- volatile
	- tells the compiler to not optimize away the variable
	- use this for device registers

```
// defined before the first function definition in a file
// what is the scope and where is it stored?

double F;
```
- scope is all functions in all files that include a corresponding extern declaration
- stored in static memory

## Understanding C Type Declarations
- **declaration**: introduces an identifier and describes its type (scalar, array, struct, or function); is what the compiler needs to accept references to that identifier
	- you may have as many declarations of an identifier as you want within a scope as long as they are consistent
- **definition**: instantiates/implements this identifier
	- ex. a definition allocates storage for variables or defines the function of the body
	- you may only have one definition of an identifier within a scope

![[../img/w10-ss5-c-type-declarations.png|450]]
- \<base type\>
	- the type (or struct s or a typedef), and optionally a storage class and/or a type qualifier
	- applies to all names up until the semicolon
- \<declarators\>
	- the list of declarator, separated by comma
	- each of these declares a type for each identifier (the variable name)
	- each is based on the base type, but stands alone
	- consists of sensible combinations of “pointer to”, “array of”, or “function returning”, ending with the base type

```int *x, y, z;```
- Note: each declarator is separate
- ```x``` is a pointer to an int
- ```y``` is just an int

```int *x, *y, *z;```
- ```x```, ```y```, ```z``` are all "pointer to an int"

## Reading And Forming Declarators
- C declarations combining pointers, arrays, and functions aren't mysterious
- Rule 1: remember the precedence of the declarators
	- () and [] declarators get processed first
	- * gets processed last
	- parentheses change the precedence order (just as in expressions)
- Rule 2: read or form the declarations from the inside out

```int *(**f)()```
	- ```f``` is a pointer to a pointer to a function returning a pointer to int

### How Do We Read Declarators Automatically?
- **parsing**: determining which grammar productions (rules) were used to generate a sentence

```
$ gcc dcl.c
$ ./a.out
int b()
b:  function returning int

int c[1]
c:  array[1] of int

int *c[1]
c:  array[1] of pointer to int

int (*c)[1]
c:  pointer to array[1] of int

int *silly()
silly:  function returning pointer to int

int **silly()
silly:  function returning pointer to pointer to int

int *(*silly)()
silly:  pointer to function returning pointer to int

int *(**f)()
f:  pointer to pointer to function returning pointer to int
```
