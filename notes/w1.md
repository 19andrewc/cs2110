# **[CS 2110] - Week 1: Big Ideas & Datatypes Part 1**
## Big Ideas
1. all computers compute the same kinds of things
	- called turing-equivalence
2. abstraction: layers makes the electrons work
3. binary
	- binary is better than decimal for electronic computing
	- easier to determine presence rather than magnitude
	- you can use lower voltages to distinguish only 0/1 rather than 0/1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9
	- binary coded decimal math takes more circuitry than pure binary
4. computers store representations of something outside
	- everything in a computer is a finite-size representation of something outside

## Datatypes Part 1
- **data representation**: the set of values from which a variable, constant, function, or other expression may take its value and includes the meaning of those values; tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use it
	- ex. the process and result of adding two variables differs greatly according to whether they are integers, floating point numbers, or strings
- **data type**: a particular representation if there are operations in the computer that can operate on information that is encoded in that representation
- **bit (binary digit)**: takes exactly two values 0 and 1

### Signed Bits
- first bit (left most bit) denotes sign
- “-” is denoted by 1
- “+” is denoted by 0

### 1’s Complement
- flip all bits (1 becomes 0, 0 becomes 1)
- bad because we waste a spot for -0

### 2’s Complement
- to negate (make positive to negative or negative to positive)
	- flip the bits, add one
- you know a 2’s complement number is negative if there is a “1” on the left-most bit

- given a negative number in 2’s complement and convert to decimal
	- flip the bits, add one, convert to decimal, take the negative of the result

- unsigned 4-bit binary number ranges from 0 to 15
- signed 4-bit binary number ranges from -8 to 7
- unsigned n-bit binary number ranges from 0 to $2^n-1$
- signed n-bit w/ 2's complement ranges from $-2^{n-1}$ to $2^{n-1}-1$

- Note: anytime you see subtraction (a-b) convert it to (a + (-b))
- Note: if you ever need to carry past the specified number of bits, DISCARD IT

### Overflow (2's Complement Addition)
- check carry in and out of the leading digit (left most digit)
- overflow occurs when 
	- there is a carry into the sign bit but no carry out
	- there is a carry out of the sign bit but no carry in
- adding two positive numbers overflows if you carry into the sign
- adding two negative numbers overflows if you dont carry in and out of the sign
- adding two opposite signed numbers never overflows

### Sign Extension
- to add bits to the left of a 2's complement number
	- fill in new bits on the left with the value of the sign bit
- ex. 1101 => 1111 1101
- ex. 0011 => 0000 0011

### Adding A Number To Itself
- $A+A \iff 2A \iff A<<1$
	- $<<$ is a left-shift operator
- $A<<n \iff A^n$

### Fractional Binary Numbers

### Truth Tables
- A AND B, A & B, AB
- A OR B, A | B, A + B
- NOT A, ~A, A'
- A XOR B, A ^ B
- A NAND B, ~(A & B)
- A NOR B, ~(A | B)


|A|B|A AND B|
|-|-|-|
|0|0|0|
|0|1|0|
|1|0|0|
|1|1|1|

|A|B|A OR B|

|0|0|0|
|0|1|1|
|1|0|1|

- there are $2^4$ two-argument boolean functions have maximum

### Left-Shift
![[../img/w1-ss9-left-shift.png|300]]
- $x<<n$ multiplies $x$ by $2^n$
	- $n$ must be $>=0$

### Right-Shift
![[../img/w1-ss10-right-shift.png|300]]
- $x>>n$ divides $x$ by $2^n$
	- $n$ must be $>=0$
- Note: the rule of dividing doesn't work all the time
	- **logical right-shift**: shifts all the bits of its operands, but does not preserve a number's sign
		- ex. 10010111 >> 1 == 01001011
	- **arithmetic right-shift**: shifts all the bits of its operands, but the left most bit is replicated to fill positions that are emptied
		- ex. 10010111 >> 1 == **1**1001011
		- ex. 00010111 >> 1 == *0*0001011

### Bit-Vectors
- 1 byte = 8 bits
- in a bit-vector, every bit is 1 boolean
- Note: by convention bit-zero starts on the right

### Manipulating Bit-Vectors
- often we use a constant (aka mask) with a boolenan function to manipulate
- when using masks, use the ~ version of the mask

- clear:: identity: $wxyz_2\ \&\ 1111_2==wxyz_2$
		- put a zero in any bit you want to clear
		- $wxyz_2\ \&\ 1101_2==wx0z_2$
- set:: identity: $wxyz_2\ |\ 0000_2==wxyz_2$
	- put a 1 in any bit you want to set
	- $wxyz_2\ |\ 0100_2==w1yz_2$
- toggle:: identity: $wxyz_2\ \textasciicircum\ 1111==\textasciitilde{w}\textasciitilde{x}\textasciitilde{y}\textasciitilde{z}_2$
	- put a 1 in any bit you want to toggle
	- $wxyz_2\ \textasciicircum\ 1000==\textasciitilde{w}xyz_2$
- to test a bit, clear all the rest
	- $wxyz_2\ \&\ 0010_2==00y0_2$
	- now you can test $00y0_2==0000_2$
- to put a 1 in any bit position n, shift left by n
	- $1<<2==0100_2$
- to put a 0 in any position, put a 1 in that position and complement
	- $\textasciitilde(1<<2)==1011_2$
	- creates as many leading ones as you need
