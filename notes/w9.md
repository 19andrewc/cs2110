# **[CS 2110] - Week 9: Interrupts, TRAPs, and Exceptions & Intro To C**
## Interrupts, TRAPs, and Exceptions
### Operating System Machine Layer
- operating systems are about sharing resources and protecting users from themselves and others
- certain operations require specialized knowledge and protection:
	- specific knowledge of I/O device registers and the sequence of operations needed to use them
	- I/O and memory resources shared among multiple users/programs (a mistake could affect lots of other users/processes)
- not every programmer knows this level of detail, so we abstract them in an operating system machine layer
- we transparently provide service to I/O devices and we notify user programs of unexpected situations
- we provide service routines or system calls (as part of operating system) to safely and conveniently perform low-level, privileged operations

### What Are Program Discontinuities?
- **interrupts**: an I/O device is reporting a completion or an error
	- ex. "read completed"
- **TRAPs**: the program is calling a privileged operating system subroutine
	- ex. "read a line from a file"
- **exceptions**: something unanticipated happened
	- hardware error in CPU or memory
	- program error like illegal opcode or divide by 
- we combine the discussion of program discontinuities because they are all handled in very similar ways
	- save the state of the CPU
	- raise the CPU privilege level
	- call an operating system routine
	- restore the state of the CPU and the privilege level
	- resume the executing program where it left off
- does this resemble an unplaned subroutine call?
	- the microcode isn't subject to program discontinuities
	- its job is to provide that abstraction for the machine language program
- properties
	- synchronous with the program (TRAPs and some exceptions) or asynchronous (interrupts and other exceptions)
	- anticipated by the programmer (TRAPs) or unanticipated (interrupts and exceptions)

### Interrupts
#### What Are They?
- modifications to the hardware of the datapath and I/O system and additional software to allow an external device to cause the CPU to stop current execution and execute a "service" routine and then resume execution of the original program
- INT is the signal that an interrupt raises

#### Why Do They Exist?
- interrupts can be significantly more efficient than polling and are especially useful in an environment where there are numerous devices and multiple concurrent activities
- polling on the other hand is appropriate where there is a high likelihood of quick success or the CPU has nothing better to do
- an interrupt is an unscripted subroutine call, triggered by an external event

### Device Status Register
- when a device goes "ready" and its interrupt enable (IE) bit is set, it will generate an interrupt signal
- there are several more steps that must allow the interrupt signal to pass before the microsequencer can see it

![[../img/w9-ss1-device-status-register.png|400]]

### Detecting Interrupts
- when the I/O device is allowed to signal an interrupt, the INT control signal to the microcode FSM is asserted
- the first state in the FETCH cycle tests to see if INT is asserted
	- if it is asserted, the microcode transfers to state 49 and sets up a call to the interrupt service routine

### Where To Save Processor State?
- can't use general purpose registers
	- the programmer doesn't know when an interrupt might occur, so they can't prepare by saving critical registers
	- when resuming, the state needs to be restored exactly as it was before
- can't use memory allocated by the service routine
	- the state must be saved before invoking the routine so the hardware would not know where (what memory to access)
- use the existing supervisor stack
	- the top of stack is already known in R6
	- push the state to save, pop the state to restore

### Supervisor Stack
- interrupts are handled on the supervisor-mode stack to protect them from user mode programs
	- R6 points to the supervisor-mode stack when the process state register is set to supervisor mode (bit-15) and to user-mode stack when it is not
- use R6 as the stack pointer so push/pop routines still work
- when swapping between modes:
	- supervisor stack pointer (SSP) is saved in saved.SSP
	- user stack pointer (USP) is saved in saved.USP
- ex. an interrupt in user mode will switch to supervisor mode, save R6 to saved.USP, and load R6 from saved.SSP

### What Is The Processor State? What 3 Items Are Needed To Capture State Of A Running Process On LC-3?
- process status register (PSR)
	- privilege \[15\], priority level \[10:8\], condition codes \[2:0\]
	- this register doesn't really exist but the hardware pushes the values onto the stack using the above format

![[../img/w9-ss2-process-status-register.png|400]]

- program counter
	-  pointer to the next instruction to be executed
- general registers
	- all temporary state of the process that is not stored in memory
- Note: privilege (P) has only two values
	- 0 is system, supervisor, kernel, or privileged mode
	- 1 is user mode or unprivileged mode

### Handling An Interrupt

![[../img/w9-ss3-handling-an-interrupt-steps.png|500]]

### Returning From Interrupt
- special instruction RTI (restores state)

![[../img/w9-ss4-rti-instruction.png|400]]

1. pop PC from supervisor stack (PC = M\[R6\]; R6 = R6 + 1)
2. pop PSR from supervisor stack (PSR = M\[R6\]; R6 = R6 + 1)
3. if PSR\[15\] = 1 -> saved.SSP = R6 -> R6 = saved.USP
	- if going back to user mode, need to restore user stack pointer
- RTI is a privileged instruction
	- can only be executed in supervisor mode
	- if executed in user mode, causes an exception

![[../img/w9-ss5-returning-from-interrupt-steps.png|250]]

### How Do We Ask Operating System To Do Things?
- use a special instruction TRAP
	- it will jump indirectly through a table provided by the operating system
	- it will elevate our privileges to supervisor mode

### TRAP vs. JSR(R)
- TRAP
	- uses trap vector table
		- can call from anywhere
		- TV table is loaded by the operating system
	- normally calls system functions
		- I/O, resource sharing, etc
	- written very carefully
	- if in user state, switch to supervisor state to allow privileged action
- JSR(R)
	- when nearby use JSR
	- everywhere else us JSRR
	- routine abstraction
	- code reuse/libraries
	- no protection mechanism

### LC-3 TRAP Mechanism
1. a set of service routines
	- they are part of the operating system - service routines start at arbitrary addresses within the operating system
		- convention is that system code lives between x2000 and x3000
	- supports up to 256 service routines
2. using a table of starting addresses
	- stored at x0000 through x00FF in memory
	- called system control block in some architectures
	- initialized by the operating system
3. TRAP instruction
	- used by program to transfer control to an operating system routine
	- 8-bit TRAP vector names one of the 256 service routines
	- saves PSR and PC on the R6 stack and gains privilege just like interrupts

### TRAP Instruction
![[../img/w9-ss6-trap-instruction.png|400]]

- TRAP vector
	- identifies the address of the system call to invoke
	- 8-bit index into TRAP vector table
		- in LC-3, this table is stored in memory at 0x0000 -> 0x00FF
		- 8-bit TRAP vector is zero-extended into 16-bit memory address

### LC-3 Trap
- think of TRAP as a special indirect JSR with a choice of memory location from 0 through 255 (called trapvect)
- the TRAP instruction saves state just like an interrupt on the system stack

### TRAP Vector Table
![[../img/w9-ss7-trap-vector-table.png|400]]

|instruction|alias|action|
|-|-|-|
|TRAP x23|IN|input character from keyboard (RO)|
|TRAP x21|OUT|print character on screen (R0)|
|TRAP x25|HALT|stops the CPU|
|TRAP x20|GETC|read a character from the keyboard (R0)|
|TRAP x22|PUTS|output a string, 1 char per word ending with x0000, address in R0|
|TRAP x24|PUTSP|output a string, 2 characters per word ending with a word of x0000, address in R0|

### Exceptions
- synchronous exceptions in the LC-3
	- divide by zero (no divide in LC-3)
	- illegal instruction (opcode=D, Table'Vector is 0x0101)
	- privileged instruction (RTI in user mode, Table'Vector is 0x0100)
	- address violation (ACV, Table'Vector is 0x0102)
- asynchronous exceptions (not implemented on LC-3)
	- processor error
	- memory error
- handled like Interrupts, but of course the vectors point to exception service routines in the operating system

## Intro To C
### Problem-Oriented Language
- a language whose statements resemble terminology of the user application-oriented language rather than machine language
-  in other words a language in which algorithms are expressed in human terminology (math, science, business) as opposed to machine implementation terms
- gives symbolic names to values
- provides expressiveness
- abstract the underlying hardware
- enhance code readability
- provide safeguards against bugs

### Generations
- ancestors
	- Fortran
	- Algol 60
	- PL/I
- parents
	- (CPL, BCPL, B) -> C
- descendants
	- Perl
	- Java
	- Python
	- C++
	- C#

### C
- C is the language that will allow you to do anything
- it is used to write operating systems, other languages, low-level hardware drivers, cryptography, networking, etc.
- it was designed to be easily compiled and to product compact, efficient code
- it won't check for many runtime errors
- Note: it was invented to implement system software for a small computer 
- C is not your friend and trusts you and will do exactly what you ask (it is quite certain you are a careful, knowledgeable programmer)
- all the symbols mean something
- "I'll just type something in and the compiler will fix it for me” won't work

### Languages
- many problem-oriented programming languages have features that try to prevent the programmer from doing something wrong or letting you know when you do
	- ex. Java does not allow you access memory by address
	- ex. Java throws an exception when you have an array out of bounds
- C is not one of these languages

### Differences Between Java And C
- C is about 49 years old and pre-dates Java by about 25 years
- C is procedural; no objects or classes
- C structs are used in place of classes
- pointers are used in place of object references
- no overloading of function names, each function must have a unique name
- C does not include strings
	- strings are arrays of characters and characters are 8-bit integers
- C does not have print or I/O built-in
	- for strings and printing, use standard C libraries

### Expressions And Control Statements
- expressions are very similar
	- all expressions (including assignments) yield a value
	- order of precedence is the same
	- no “new” ,“instanceof”, or >>> (from Java)
	- C does have: “sizeof”, unary &, unary *, and binary ->
- control statements are quite similar
	- old friends “if”, “while”, “do-while”, “for”, “switch”, “break”, “continue”, “return”

### Data Types
- integer types

|type|size|
|-|-|
|unsigned char|8 bits|
|unsigned short \[int\]|16 bits|
|unsigned int|16/32 bits|
|unsigned long \[int\]|32/64 bits|
|unsigned long long \[int\]|64 bits|

- floating point types

|type|size|
|-|-|
|float|32 bits|
|double|64 bits|
|long double|80/128 bits|

- aggregate types
	- array
	- struct
	- union

- pointers (a special kind of integer)

### How Big A Data Type Is Depends...
- it depends on your platform
	- char (exactly 8 bits)
	- short int (at least 16 bits)
	- int (at least 16 bits)
	- long int (at least 32 bits)
- you can find the size of a datatype with "sizeof"
	- "sizeof" is a compile-time constant reflecting the number of bytes held by a data type or instance
	- sizeof(char) <= sizeof(short) <= sizeof(int) <= sizeof(long)
	- sizeof(char) = 1

### Booleans
- C historically did not have a boolean data type
	- instead we can use integers to represent boolean values
- any integer that is 0 evaluates as false
- any non-zero integer evaluates as true
- NUL character '\'\0' evaluates to false
- a memory address that is 0x0 evaluates as false

### Strings
- strings are arrays of characters
- strings end with an ASCII NUL (aka '\\0')

```
// defining a string
char mystr[6]

// initializing a string
char mystr[6]= {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'};

// initializing a string (C compiler determines length of array)
char mystr[] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'};
char mystr[] = "Hello";

// functions dealing with strings
strlen()
strcpy()
strdup()
```

```char s[6] = "hello"```
- is the same as ```s .stringz "hello" ;6 memory locations, ends with 0```
- s is the memory address where the string starts
- Note: never use ```sizeof(s)``` when you want string length
	- include ```#include ,string.h>``` and use ```strlen(s)``` for string length

### printf()
- printf() is a function in the Standard IO Library
	- make sure to add ```#include <stdio.h>```

|format code|meaning|
|-|-|
|%d|decimal integer (int)|
|%x|hex integer (int)|
|%f|floating number(float)|
|%s|string (char * or char \[\])|
|%c|character (char)|
|%p|pointer (for debugging)|

- ex. ```printf("Person: %s  GPA: %f\n", name, gpa);``` might print ```Person: Dan  GPA: 2.5```

### The C Preprocessor
- the C preprocessor does two main things
	- file inclusion (#include)
	- macro expansion (#define)
- preprocessor directives always start with #

### # include
- conventionally, we only include files that end in ".h"
- these consist of declarations (including function prototypes) and macro definitions but no executable code
- if you surround the file name with:
	- double quotes (""), the preprocessor looks in the current directory and then the system directories for the file
	- angle brackets (<>), it looks only in the system directories (/usr/include)
- the lines in an # included file are literally copied in place of the # include

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include "mylibrary.h"
```
- Note: these lines do not end in a semicolon

### Macro Processing
- macro processing: text substitution using some very specific rules
- we're going to want to use symbolic names for constants in several places
	- ex. ```#define NUL_CHAR '\'```
	- ex. ```#define MAXWORDLEN 256```
- these symbolic names are textually replaced in the source code
- if you invoke the compiler with ````gcc -E````, it will show you the preprocessed input file with all the # includes and\ macros expanded

### Macro Processing Example
```
/* before C proprocessing */

#define NUL_CHAR '\'
#define MAXWORDLEN 256

char buf[MAXWORDLEN];
while (buf[i] != NUL_CHAR && i < MAXWORDLEN)
	i++;


/* after C proprocessing */

#define NUL_CHAR '\'
#define MAXWORDLEN 256

char buf[256];
while (buf[i] != '\0' && i < 256)
	i++;
```

### Macros With Arguments
- you can also use macros like functions

```
#define PRODUCT(a, b) a*b
```
```PRODUCT(4, 5)``` would expand to ```4*5```
```PROUDCT(x+3, y+4)``` would expand to ```x+3*y+\4```

- to fix this issue, we would do:
```
#define PRODUCT(a, b) ((a)*(b))
```
```PRODUCT(x+3, y+4)``` would expand to ```(x+3)*(y+4)```

### Structs
- **struct**: a data type that is used to group together multiple values; contains no methods
	- all data members are publicly visible
- use the `.` operator to access variables inside a struct
- if given a pointer to a struct, use the `->` operator to simultaneously dereference and access it

![[../img/w9-ss8-structs.png|500]]

- the struct tag declares the type (Note: for the above, the type is 'struct a')
- names following the struct tag defines instances of the struct
	- ex. ```struct car mikes_car, joes_car;```
- identifier/function names and struct tags occupy separate name spaces
- struct members occupy a name space unique to the containing struct, meaning that ```struct b { int b } b;``` is legal and not ambiguous
- you can declare a struct type and define an instance (or multiple instances) of the variable at the same time

```
struct car {
	char mfg[30];
	char model[30];
	int year;
} mikes_car;
```
- Note: ```struct car``` is a data type but ```mikes_car``` is a variable of type ```struct car```

### Referencing Structure Members
- the ```.``` operator is used just as in Java to reference members of a structure

```
printf(%s\n", mikes_car.model);


/* you can't assign a string literal to an array in C */
/* the following is wrong */
johns_car.mfg = "Chevrolet"; 


/* you can use strcpy() and you must make sure your destination has room to hold the source string */
/* don't forget to #include <string.h> */
strcpy(johns_car.mfg, "Chevorlet");
```

### Pointers
- can do the same things you do with addresses in an assembly language
- powerful and potentially dangerous
- no runtime checking (for efficiency)
- Java avoids many of the features of pointers that cause problems, hence the decision to call them references
- in Java:
	- no "address of" of "deference" operator
	- no pointer arithmetic
	- no casting of integer types to pointer types
- pointers contain memory addresses (or NULL)

```
; in assembly we write...
B		.fill	29
BADDR	.fill	B
```
```
/* in C we write... */
int b = 29;
int *baddr = &b;
```
- Note: & (ampersand) is the "address of" operator; use it to obtain a pointer to an existing data item

### Using Pointers Example 1
- to reference what a pointer points to, we use the deference operator ```*```
-  ```*``` acts like "indirect" in LC-3 loads and stores
-  in LC-3 assembly, if we wanted to use BADDR to access the value in B, we used

```
LDI		R1, BADDR	;get B
ADD		R1, R1, #2
STI		R1, BADDR	;set B = R1
```

- in C we write ```*baddr = *baddr + 2```

### Using Pointers Example 2
```
int b = 29;
int *baddr = &b;

printf(“%d\n”, b);
*baddr = 18;
printf(“%d\n”, b);
printf(“%d\n”, *baddr);

/* the above prints the following */
29
18
18
```
- the value stored at ```b``` has been changed to 18
- ```baddr``` still contains the address of ```b```

### * Has 2 Meanings
- don't let the ```*``` in declarations confuse you about executable statements
- in a type declaration, ```*``` means "pointer to" and is part of the type
- in an expression, ```*``` is the "dereference" operator and acts like the "indirect" in the LC-3 loads and stores
- when applied to a pointer, ```*``` makes the expression mean "what this pointer points to"

```
/* declaration */
int i, x;
int *px = &x;

/* expression */
i = *px
```

- ex. given ```int *ptrx = *y```, what must the type of y be?
	- y is a pointer to a pointer to an int
		- this is because ptrx is a pointer to an int and *y must be an int, then y must be a pointer to a pointer to an int

### Pointers And Arrays
```
int a[10]
int *p
```
- ```a``` is an array of type int and size 10
- p is a pointer to int (memory address)
- in an expression, an array name becomes a constant pointer to the first element (ex. ```a```)
- ```a``` is the memory where the arrays starts
- ```a``` can't be changed (but its contents can)
- ```a``` is the address of ```a[0]```

```
int a[10]
int *p

// legal
p = a		// p is the memory address of the start of the array

// illegal
a = p		// a is a constant pointer
			// you are not allowed to change its value
```

### Strings And Pointers
```
char str[6] = "Hello";
char *s
```

- Note: a C string is really an array of char
- when you see ```char *``` think string

### Pointer Arithmetic
- you can add or subtract pointers and integers
	- a pointer plus or minus an integer yields a pointer
 - just like adding to addresses on LC-3 with one additional semantic

```
int *p = &i;
p = p + 1;		// is interpreted as p = p + 1 * sizeof(*p)
```
- Note: essentially, if p is an int pointer, p + 1 is the address of the next int
	- the address in p is incremented by the size of an int

```
int b[3] = {9, 12, 13};
int *p = &b[0]
```
- the value of ```*p``` is 9
- the value of ```*(p + 1)``` is 12
- the value of ```*(p + 2)``` is 13
- in an expression, ```a[i]``` means exactly the same as ```*(a + i)```
	- this is why ```p[0] = 9, p[1] = 12, p[3] = 13```

```
// the following expressions are equivalent (an int)
a[5] <--> *(a + 5)
p[5] <--> *(p + 5)


// the following expressionsn are equivalent (pointer to an int)
&a[5] <--> a + 5
&p[5] <--> p + 5
```

### Pointer Arithmetic Example
```
int x = 3;
int y = 72;
int *px = &x;
int *py = &y;
*px = 7;
py = px;
x = 12;
printf("%d %d\n", *px, *py);

// What is the output?
// 12 12
```

- the solution is ```12 12``` since ```*px``` and ```*py``` both evaluate to 12 since they are now both pointing to ```x```

![[../img/w9-ss10-tracing-pointer-arithmetic-ex.png|300]]

### Pointers And Structs
- C supports the operator ```->```
- the left operand must be a pointer to struct and the right operand a struct member
- ```->``` is a shorthand for ```*``` and ```.```

```
struct myStruct {
	int a, b;
}, *p; // p is a pointer to struct myStruct


// the following statements have the same meaning
(*p).a = (*p).b
p -> a = p -> b
```

### Functions
```
int mult(int a, int b) {
	return a * b
}
```
- two arguments (int) are pushed onto the stack
- returns an int
- pass by value always (not by reference)
- copies of arguments are pushed onto the stack

### Functions: main()
```
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	return 0;
}
```
- ```main()``` is just another function
- it is the first function invoked when you run your program from the command line
- Note: the convention is to return 0 on success, or non-0 on error

### Functions: void
```
void func(void) {
	printf("Hello\n")
}
```
- void is a special keyword
- return type void
	- the function does not return a value
- arguments of void
	- the function does not take any arguments

### Functions: Arrays As Arguments
```
char s[] = "Hello";

void test(char *s) {
	printf("%s\n", s)
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	// the following statements have the same meaning
	test(s)			// pointer of s
	test(&s[0])		// address of s at index 0
}
```
- to pass an array into a function, we pass a pointer to the first element
- Note: an array name in an expression (function call) is automatically promoted to a pointer to its first element
	- this includes strings (arrays of char)

### Declare Functions Before You Call Them
```
// function prototypes
int foo(int);
int bar(char *);

int main() {
	foo(1);
	bar("Bye");
}


// function definition
int foo(int i) {
	// do something
}

// function definition
int bar(char *s) {
	// do something
}
```
- Note: we often put the main() function first but main() needs to know about the functions it will call
	- we add declarations (function prototypes) above the main() that just have name, return type, and args
	- we add function definitions under the main() with the actual implementation

### Command Line Arguments
```
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	return 0;
}
```
- ```argc``` is the number of arguments (including the program name itself)
	- think "argument count"
- ```argv``` is an array of strings
	- aka an array of pointer to char
	- think "argument values"
- call our program by typing ```./myprogram cs2110 rocks``` in the command line
	- argc == 3
	- argv\[0\] is "./myprogram"
	- argv\[1\] is "cs2110"
	- argv\[2\] is "rocks"

### Hello World! (With C)
```
// file name: helloworld.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	printf("Hello, World!\n\n");
	
	for (int i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
		printf("Argument %d: '%s'", i, argv[i])
	}
	printf("You have %d arguments.\n", argc);
}
```

- in the terminal, do the following to run the program

```
// compiles helloworld.c and creates a.out file
$ gcc helloworld.c

// run a.out
$ ./a.out

```
